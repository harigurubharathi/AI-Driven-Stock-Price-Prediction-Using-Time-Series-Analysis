1. Import Libraries:
Imports necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and matplotlib.
2. Load Data:
Loads stock data from a CSV file (replace 'your_stock_data.csv' with your actual file). It assumes the first column is a date and parses it accordingly.
3. Prepare Data:
Calculates mid-prices (average of high and low) for simplicity. You can adapt this to use other features.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Scales the data using MinMaxScaler to normalize values between 0 and 1. This is crucial for LSTM performance.
Creates sequences of data using the create_sequences function. This prepares the data for the LSTM model.
Reshapes the data into the required format (samples, time steps, features) for the LSTM.
